    <h1>Node-Course</h1>
    <p>The Node course is a programming course that focuses on teaching students how to use Node.js, a runtime environment that
    allows developers to write server-side applications using JavaScript. Students learn how to build web applications,
    APIs, and other server-side projects using Node.js, as well as how to work with data, handle requests, and manage
    dependencies. The course typically covers topics such as asynchronous programming, event handling, package management,
    and building server applications. By the end of the course, students should have a good understanding of how to use
    Node.js to create powerful and efficient server-sideÂ applications.</p>
